Beginning on April 2, 2025, global stock markets began to experience significant economic downturn, as a result of tariffs and trade wars initiated by U.S. president Donald Trump. On that day, President Trump declared "Liberation Day", announcing sweeping tariffs that would affect almost all aspects of the U.S. economy. His admission to allegations that he was intentionally attempting to cause a stock crash increased economic tensions with allies, as well as the possibility of a global trade war and recession. Global stock markets, including in the United States following "Liberation Day", experienced panic selling. It is currently the largest decline in the global stock market since the 2020 stock market crash, which was part of a recession caused by the COVID−19 pandemic.

Trump's second term inherited a particularly strong domestic stock market. While this was maintained for a period of a few weeks after his inauguration, the Trump administration began making and announcing increasingly aggressive trade policies in an attempt to practice protectionism and economic pressure, including heightening previous trade wars, starting new trade wars, heavy tariffs, and increasing tensions with allies, most prominently with Canada.  As the administration continued to practice these policies, markets began to experience continued turbulence, volatility, and general uncertainty.

The Dow Jones index lost 4,000 points in the span of 48 hours, the first back-to-back 1,500+ loss in its history. Japan's Nikkei dived nearly 8%, triggering a trading curb. The Canadian TSX decreased by 4.8% in one day. VIX market volatility doubled, skyrocketing to more than half of the heights it had achieved during the pandemic, and an increased risk of a recession, and the possibility of economic retaliation exacerbated the effects.

 Background 
thumb|right|300px|Some of the tariffs introduced on April 2, 2025. Note that the figures for "Tariffs Charged to the U.S.A." are based on trade deficits, not tariffs.

Since the start of his second term, Donald Trump has pursued a policy of economic autonomy and economic protectionism, in an attempt to incentivize U.S.-based industry growth and reduce the country's trade deficit. As part of this, the Trump administration began using tariffs to induce other countries to buy and invest in American products and industry. This heightened tensions in the already ongoing U.S−China trade war as higher tariff rates were introduced, and initiated a trade war with Mexico and Canada through new tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports. This gradually created stock market instability and raised fears of a possible recession. By February 2025, the stock market had entered a decline.

On March 21, 2025, Trump announced a "Liberation Day" on which he would present large-scale tariffs onto countries with a trade deficit. Though no specifics were provided beyond promising larger tariffs, fears of a larger trade war began to create more market volatility. Prior to the announcement, the S&P 500 dropped by 10.1% by March 13 of that year, following its February peak. Donald Trump announced Liberation Day would occur on April 2, because he "didn't want [it] to be April Fool's Day because then nobody would believe what I said", and that on that day, he would introduce worldwide tariffs. Trump imposed the tariffs unilaterally under powers granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by declaring that the United States' ongoing trade deficit was a national emergency. Upon their introduction, the new tariffs were considered incredibly sweeping, including but not limited to: a 10% "baseline" tariff imposed on all imports barring a few resource exceptions (including on the uninhabited McDonald Islands), a 54% rate for China, a 20% rate for the European Union, 46% for Vietnam, 36% for Thailand, 24% for Japan, 49% for Cambodia, and 32% for Taiwan.

While economic protectionism became increasingly popular among Americans over the last decade, the sweeping tariffs immediately faced heavy backlash from many Americans, including protectionists, both Republican Party and Democratic Party officials,  and economists citing it as an abuse of power, an over-extension of economic policy, a "worse than the worst case scenario" for U.S markets or a potential "Black Monday" related-event. The tariffs also precipitated concern among world leaders.

 Initial downturn 
 North America 
Upon the market opening on April 3, the Nasdaq lost 1,600 points, the worst sell-off since the start of the COVID−19 pandemic. The S&P 500 lost 6.65% of its value on April 3, nearly initiating a trading curb (which begins at 7%.). The following day, April 4, China imposed a 34% retaliatory tariff. This plunged the Dow Jones index by over 2,200 points, S&P 500 losing 6% once again, and, following the Nasdaq losing 5.8, entered bear market territory. Within the two days, the Dow Jones index lost over 4,000 points (9.48%), S&P losing 10%, and Nasdaq losing 11%. Market volatility began to skyrocket, at over double its previous percentage before April 2, nearly reaching its COVID-19 pandemic level and climbing.

April 34 was the first time in American history the Dow Jones index shed over 1.5k points in back-to-back days. The two−day period also ranked as the worst ever for the S&P 500. By April 4, the United States stock market lost nearly $5 trillion dollars. Additionally, oil prices experienced a 7% decline by April 4, the lowest since 2021. At the time of the markets opening on April 7, stocks plunged further. The threeday losses became the worst since Black Monday. Just after 10 a.m. EDT on April 7, Walter Bloomberg of CNBC reported that Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, stated that the Trump administration was considering a 90day pause on all tariffs excluding China, resulting in a temporary upturn in markets. Within forty minutes, at around 10:40 a.m. EDT, the Rapid Response 47 Twitter account indicated that this was "fake news". The markets responded by decreasing once again within a hour. By the time that the US markets had closed on that day, modestly lower than the previous day on April 6, the Dow Jones index ended up losing over 300 points, though Nasdaq had a slight increase after recording the largest intraday comeback since 2008.

 International 
Crude oil began to experience a significant decline in price. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) showed a sharp decline, dropping below $60 per barrel. It reached as low as $58.95 before a slight recovery but maintained the weakest position since 2021. Brent crude fell by 3.7% to $63.15 per barrel, also marking its lowest level since 2021. These drops occurred due to the fears of a possible recession and thereby a decrease in the demand for oil. Similarly, base metals, such as copper, and the coffee industry both saw a decline in price amid recession fears. The coffee industry is almost entirely located within regions with tariffs applied by the United States, a country that intakes a large sum of coffee grounds through imports.

The Canadian TSX decreased by 3.8% within 24 hours, followed by 4.6% the following day, April 4.

 Asia 
In Korea, the KOSPI Composite Index fell over 5%. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 experienced its largest loss since March of 2020 at 7%, triggering a trading curb, and extending the economic downturn it had experienced over the last week at 9%. Futures trading was temporarily halted due to the trading curb. The S&P/ASX 200 was resilient the first few days, sustaining only a small decrease, however, April 7 saw it drop by 6% within 30 minutes.

 Europe 
The STOX 600 index saw a decrease of 2.6% on 3 April before falling 3.1% the next day. The week's 8.4% loss was the index's worst week in five years. The following trade week, starting April 7, it fell by 6% before closing at a 4.54% decrease. On 7 April, Barclays downgraded its end of year predictions for the index from 580 to 490 while warning that its forecast had little weight because "there is no precedent, nor fundamental framework to rely on for this crisis."

The FTSE 100 dropped almost 5% on April 4, marking a three−month low and the largest daily drop since March 2020; every stock on the index fell except from JD Sports. The FTSE 250 also fell, dropping 4.4% to a 16−month low. Upon opening on April 7, the FTSE 100 fell by more than 6% but recovered slightly by the end of the day, resulting in a decrease of 4.25%.

The Spanish IBEX fell 5.83% on 4 April, its largest decrease of the year. On 7 April, it dropped a further 7% before closing 5.12% down, with the prices of all of the constituent stocks falling.

Africa
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the largest in Africa, experienced its greatest decrease of the year losing more than 9% of its value after Trump ordered tariffs of 30% on South Africa.

 Response 

 United States 

After the US stock market lost significant value, President Donald Trump said on April 3 regarding his tariffs that events were "going very well", as the "markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom". The next day, Trump addressed investors, declaring on social media: "my policies will never change. This is a great time to get rich, richer than ever before!!!" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent commented on April 6: "I see no reason that we have to price in a recession".

Despite Trump's insistence, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell refused to issue emergency cuts to lower interest rates. On April 4, Trump shared a video on social media claiming that he is crashing the stock market on purpose to force the Fed to lower interest rates.

 Golf trip 
Trump received widespread criticism for continuing with a planned golf trip and fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago resort estate in Florida during the crash. On April 7, he responded with a social media post telling people "Don't be a PANICAN (a new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)"

Democratic Party Senator Adam Schiff, who was on NBC's Meet the Press, stated that "I think people have seen their retirement savings on fire. And there he is out on the golf course".

 International 
Germany
In response to the tariffs, the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated "This is an attack on a trade order [...] that is essentially a result of American efforts".

Australia
The prime minister of Australia Anthony Albanese reacted to the tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited external territory of Australia, saying "It just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on Earth is safe from this". On April 7, Australian stocks began to fall substantially.

 China 
On the same day as "Liberation Day", China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% against the United States, as a response to the tariffs placed on them, starting on April 10. Donald Trump responded to this on Truth Social proclaiming "China played it wrong, they panicked − the one thing they cannot afford to do!" implying that the tariffs on China would not be lifted, eventually leading to another drop in stocks.

The Chinese stock market lost considerable value along with other global markets. In response, China suspended imports from some American companies and put export controls on earth minerals and various technologies. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian called the tariffs "protectionist bullying", while imploring American companies to take steps to safeguard the stability of the global supply chain. On April 8, some Chinese state-owned enterprises announced to increase share investment to calm markets in response of U.S. tariffs.

 Corporations 
Companies Klarna, Chime, and StubHub all paused IPO plans due to the stock market's volatility.
