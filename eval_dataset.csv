What caused the 2025 stock market crash?,"The 2025 stock market crash was primarily triggered by sweeping tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on April 2nd, 2025, which he termed ""Liberation Day"".  These tariffs affected nearly all aspects of the U.S. economy and were implemented as part of a policy of economic autonomy and protectionism.  Trump's admission that he intentionally aimed to cause a stock market crash further exacerbated the situation, escalating tensions with allies and increasing the risk of a global trade war and recession.  The resulting panic selling led to the largest global stock market decline since the 2020 crash.  The imposition of retaliatory tariffs, particularly a 34% tariff from China, amplified the downturn.","['Initial downturn \n North America \nUpon the market opening on April 3, the Nasdaq lost 1,600 points, the worst sell-off since the start of the COVID−19 pandemic.

 'Beginning on April 2, 2025, global stock markets began to experience significant economic downturn, as a result of tariffs and trade wars initiated by U.S. president Donald Trump.

His admission to allegations that he[Trump] was intentionally attempting to cause a stock crash increased economic tensions with allies, as well as the possibility of a global trade war and recession.

 ""Market crash \nthumb|Indonesia Stock Exchange Composite Index during closing around 9:37 AM on 18 March 2025\nIn March 2025, Indonesia's financial markets faced a severe jolt as the Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) plunged by over 7% in a single trading session.

Foreign ownership in the JCI also fell to 2.9%, the lowest since 2011, reflecting a decline in global interest in the Indonesian market. This contrasted with other Asian bourses that rallied.  The negative market sentiment was fuelled by concerns over national economic conditions. The sudden downturn reflected a deepening crisis of investor confidence, rooted not only in macroeconomic uncertainties but also in political anxieties and shifting fiscal policies under President Prabowo Subianto’s administration. In February alone, the state budget (APBN) recorded a deficit of IDR 31.2 trillion, while the consumer confidence index and savings ratio fell, indicating weak purchasing power. Layoffs increased, with major factories such as Yamaha and PT Sanken Indonesia closing. Tax revenue also weakened, with Income Tax 21 falling 39.5% YoY and IPR declining by 0.5% signalling consumption pressure.

 'Beginning on April 2, 2025, global stock markets began to experience significant economic downturn, as a result of tariffs and trade wars initiated by U.S. president Donald Trump. On that day, President Trump declared ""Liberation Day"", announcing sweeping tariffs that would affect almost all aspects of the U.S. economy. His admission to allegations that he[Trump] was intentionally attempting to cause a stock crash increased economic tensions with allies, as well as the possibility of a global trade war and recession.

It is currently the largest decline in the global stock market since the 2020 stock market crash, which was part of a recession caused by the COVID−19 pandemic.'

 ""Since the start of his[Trump] second term, Donald Trump has pursued a policy of economic autonomy and economic protectionism, in an attempt to incentivize U.S.-based industry growth and reduce the country's trade deficit. As part of this[pursued], the Trump administration began using tariffs to induce other countries to buy and invest in American products and industry. This heightened tensions in the already ongoing U.S−China trade war as higher tariff rates were introduced, and initiated a trade war with Mexico and Canada through new tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports. This gradually created stock market instability and raised fears of a possible recession. By February 2025, the stock market had entered a decline.""
 ""Trump's second term inherited a particularly strong domestic stock market. While this[a particularly strong domestic stock market] was maintained for a period of a few weeks after his[Trump] inauguration, the Trump administration began making and announcing increasingly aggressive trade policies in an attempt to practice protectionism and economic pressure, including heightening previous trade wars, starting new trade wars, heavy tariffs, and increasing tensions with allies, most prominently with Canada.  As the administration continued to practice these policies, markets began to experience continued turbulence, volatility, and general uncertainty.""
